shit okay so i may have watched the entirety of made in abyss in one day
it has a common problem among anime called being animated by pedophiles, 
but the worldbuilding, ozen's design and nanachi are all pretty great
and there is an episode at which the series picks up and it's called episode ten
because thats when the chekov's gun from the first episode, where it's expo'd that ascending from the deeper parts of the abyss causes bleeding out of every orifice in your body, fires
i liked the bits of worldbuilding where the curse is caused by the forcefield, ozen's relic is a resurrection pod instead of a stasis chamber, and there exists parasitic mushrooms that store healing fluid and revive their host when they die that can be harvested for medicinal properties
nanachi is neat on the sole basis that they took survivor's guilt and amplified it until they got a multi-dimensional character
and ozen's design carries
the thing that stops me from recommending it is the fact that maybe we should not make sexual jokes when all the characters are straight up elementary school students

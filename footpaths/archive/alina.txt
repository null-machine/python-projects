hell yeah
a lot of things immediately clicked
there's a lot of stuff that seems kind of universal across genres
e.g. block strats being absolute garbage

the most novel thing it has is probably the weapon swap system
you have a left hand and you have a right hand and you put a weapon in each (or use a two handed one but ive found the two handed weapons to be garbage since the payoff is so small compared to giving up the flexibility of hand swapping) 
* obligatory disclaimer these are observations across literally two runs so idk
uhh, some of your cards are blue, some are red, some are grey
there's a pool of red/blue cards and a pool of grey cards
red blue cards directly use weapon effects
and weapons provide a damage bonus and special effects
including range changes which is really cool
lances increase all cards of the weapon's colour by 1, crossbows (best in the game) increase it by a lot more than that
but require reloading
aka each time you fire a card from that weapon you need to discard a card of matching colour to reload it
given slay the spire's draw system i found the penalty to be pretty easy to ignore

the kicker is, before you use either weapon during a turn, you can swap them as you see fit
so you just have infinite hand swaps
which really helps to reward forward thinking
e.g. i see 3 blues and 2 reds and crossbow is loaded and currently on red 
i do a swap so i can shoot reload shoot while my other hand (i usually take a melee) just plays the two reds normally
oh yeah and heavy weapons add a fatigue status to your hand each time they're used
it's a pretty cool system
but the micro eventually got a little grating
game feel wasnt very fluid
but it's a novel concept and so i respect it
the game is also kind of
distinctly... whats the word
game jammy? a bit rough on the polish side?
feels like you see a lot of what exists in the first run

theres not much to unlock or slowly be introduced to
the learning curve is kind but plateaus a lot faster than i hoped
... either that or playing ruina made me really crave ridiculously deep strategy
which is an itch that is hard to scratch outside of it hahaha

i considered it
but i don't like modded workflows
i'd sooner just work on my own games
oh yeah another place where alina greatly differs from hlts
in alina, movement is REALLY hard to come by
things move like, maybe one tile per turn
or opponents have scripted movements e.g. jump to center of arena after a certain threshold
as the player, you usually have 1 movement and maybe 2 movement on a good day
which makes sense because literally everything in the game can be invalidated with movement
which is what made me realize blocking is garbage
meanwhile in hlts i have reaver hawks that move 6 tiles a turn ahahaha
but yeah it's... fine
the game is ok
i think the weapons system and the design philosophies are holding it back a bit
it's deep in a way that awkwardly does not go deep enough to result in 5d tactics but is also not shallow enough to have good game feel

that makes sense
u should keep this analysis somewhere it's like swag

also some cards are just really bad hahaha
it kind of reminds me of maybe my criticism for paizo aka starfinder / pathfinder systems
there's a overwhelming amount of variety and choices
but so many of them just seem instantly dismissable
i'd rather have a smaller pool of choices with more of them worth consideration or having a clear niche
slay the spire does that very well
they started from overpowered archetypes and worked backwards from there to get the cards
alina feels like... i can't tell what it's trying to prioritize
anyways those are mostly my thoughts after two runs
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i still overall liked it because it's hex
art good
but wouldnt mind losing some marketability for more deranged tactics / opponent variety
also straight up add 2-8 to every single block value in the game i swear it wont break the balance

the most unmarketable games have the best gameplay that simply is how it must be

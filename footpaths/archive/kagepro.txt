yeah. if i had to take one group of characters from kagepro it's just the yuukei quartet (shintaro, takane, ayano, haruka)
they form a pretty fun way of exploring what a functioning or dysfunctioning support network looks like

they all have a lot going on and in every single timeline they collapse in a different way
god. fixits are needed though
imagine being gifted with foresight from hundreds of failed resets and having control over the power so poor you end up exploding each time anyways
or gaining insight too late every single time
nvm thats not true the alpha timeline was
well
it's a little blurry
but it takes a while for shintaro to get the retaining eyes
i think the alpha timeline takes place right after though
which is when he actually uses it to overpower clearing eyes and save everyone with admittedly a pretty big brain move

retaining eyes remembers every single reset
in the reset right before alpha, ayano turns herself into the snake of retaining eyes and takes residence in alpha timeline shintaro
which causes him to do some pretty big brain plays that makes everything work out in the end
snake of clearing eyes is the antagonist
gifted with the knowledge of the original medusa (so extensive knowledge about the mortal realm and an insane amount of cynicism)
serves as primary antagonist because it wants to just create a new medusa to wipe the world for its transgressions against snake jesus 
creating a new medusa means assembling all the snakes to the queen sna-
i despise how much i know about this stupid multimedia entity
but yeah everyone has a power, each time someone dies, their power goes to the queen, if queen assembles all then thats the medusa
in most timelines, the queen laments the death of everyone else and uses the power to reset
this is technically desirable to the clearing eyes snake because ayano caught onto its plan

what's assembling a snake?

- each time someone dies on aug 15, if they have a strong desire, they pick up a snake and revive. each snake is associated with a power
- if a snake bearer dies, their snake goes to the bearer of the queen snake, who happens to be a descendant of the original medusa
- by assembling every single snake, a new medusa is born, who basically has the power to cause a global cataclysm, which is desirable by the snake of clearing eyes

theres only one medusa and she died to create all the individual snakes
well, theres asterisks there
but i
i once again despise just how much i know about kagepro
- so the goal of clearing eyes is to kill off every single revived snake bearer to assemble the complete medusa to wipe the world for its transgressions against azami
- ayano, being the daughter of a medusa researcher, catches on, and does a pro gamer move called dying with a strong desire to receive a snake, but refusing to revive, in hopes of this making the clearing eyes snake realize its plan has been foiled so it wouldnt kill off all the other snake bearers, who she is friends or siblings with
- clearing eyes goes lol lmao i'll just get the queen snake to perform a reset anyways so they kill off all the queen's friends anyways to pressure her to reset
and that happens over and over and over
until shenanigans
and good ending
shenanigans as in shintaro also catches on and also deliberately enters the daze and teams up with ayano to simultaneously revive to grant the queen snake knowledge of millennia past to get enough experience to manipulate every single power to just thoroughly defeat the clearing eyes snake
once again, asterisks
including mekakucity actors timeline somehow introducing a power of the queen snake that lets her acquire snakes without killing their bearers
it's tangled but i think i have it comprehensible to myself

wait so if there are more snake bearers being made via dying. do they just have to keep killing until everyone including the new ones are dead

theres a set number of snakes
who form the cast of kagepro

s h r u g
azami said so
/ each represented a desire from azami or one of azami's original powers
who she was just born with
yeah azami's powers are hard coded
and when she created the kagerou daze, each of her powers became an individual snake

all snakes exist to fulfill a desire
and everyone in the kagepro cast died with a different desire
so the snakes differentiate them
it's pretty good character design
however,
despite the complexity of the plot
it doesnt really say anything or build to any messages besides serving as a mechanism for exploring a morbillion aus
i guess thats good enough but
as a consequence, it is self referential and unapproachable
"not for me though, i read homestuck, i'm used to it"

Ha
so true
yeah, i guess things don't have to build up to big messages to be fun bc characters can really carry and sometimes having fun is simply swag!! my beef is usually when things build up messages that actively suck (cough)

07/02/2023 23:55
heheheh
kagepro doesnt have a message that sucks, its dominant message is to value your friends and appreciate them while you can
however.
it has some themes that suck, the main one being unhealthy levels of dependence
a significant amount of timelines collapse to domino suicides and i just don't think that is either realistic or should be romanticized 
like. commitment is good in moderation but that is not a healthy way to love
which is one of the beefs i have with it hrmph
shintaro's support network in a few timelines is takane, haruka and ayano
ayano dies in her attempt to foil the clearing eyes snake, haruka dies to his illness, and takane gets killed by the clearing eyes snake all on the same day
causing him to become a shut in
in certain timelines, this branches again to him killing himself and the revived takane later on
the alpha timeline solves this in a way that makes sense but doesnt really make me feel anything

so i'm mostly trying to find a fixit for that timeline
one fic came close, where retaining eyes awakens earlier than normal and gets shintaro to start talking to the yuukei quartet more
and it honestly started pretty good!

had a lot of fun conflict from exploring how kano can interfere with that
whose ability is mimicry (canonically deception but mimicry is more accurate)
who mimics ayano for more reasons i cannot be bothered to explain
causing a lot of shintaro's efforts to fall flat in a way that generates a lot of tension
and seeing his efforts to prevent takane from domino-ing from haruka is really neat too
/ trying to stop or bring swifter care to the heart attack that kills him too
but yeah finding a fixit for the quartet in that timeline is really neat to me
unfortunately, it devolved into some pretty bad writing which i will never forgive aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaughgh it came so close

- clawing and tearing his way to his own idealized redemption at the cost of any humiliation, introspection and rewiring necessary is absolutely fascinating to me
- nobody explicitly told him to be a pacifist. he knew that in the atrium, taking up arms or prioritizing his own life would ultimately give him the means to save more people in the long run. but at that point, he made up his mind on what rules to follow for redemption and refused to break them no matter what, which i think is morbidly inspiring (and also a delightful contrast to prowl)
- probably has the strongest morals in the cast. which is pretty fun when you think about that field of blue flowers
- trying to return to an impossible ground zero from before the war
- the epitome of being true to yourself and keeping what matters close at heart i guess

whirl
- positively dripping
- if you don't think about it, whirl has quite a bit in common with megatron... instead of having a steadfast moral code etched in steel it's just a dedication to violence
- funny out of ten

domey
- memory shenanigans make for memorable stories
- the reveal that she wasn't born dry but rather gave all her innermost energon to lost ones and then erased them from memory left me absolutely reeling since it recontextualized mnemosurgery in a way i hadn't thought about yet
- that possibility also made me wonder if she only rushed to mercy kill rewind because she thought she would have been able to erase the trauma after which makes for reasonably fun angst
- dramatic pessimistic demeanour makes her quite likeable too
- vaguely aware of a history with prowl but that just gives me more content to work with in the future

prowl
- gives me a headache
- serves as an adversarial role model. if i have to ask myself what to do or if something is right, i should not discount the thought process of "what would prowl say" and then do the complete polar opposite
- the fact that the world has arguably been saved repeatedly by this petty self-centered control freak that has personally screwed over every last one of his friends bothers me so so so much
- has a rigid moral code that's wrong in the moment but is proven right in the long term and that dissonance gives me a migraine
- makes me think about moral limits, where lines should be drawn, and whether people like him are necessary to make a better world

Great news the erratic card slay the spire episode might be my favourite
if i were to describe who the chara reminds me of id say sun wukong
except as an umineko witch that torments people with their own memories
and likes the story of the mirror in snow white whose dialogue can be interpreted as a manifestation of the queen's vanity 
ofc the eps are really short so going into depth is out of the question but it's fun enough

ok so
last ep of katanagatari
this series is a solid 5/10
i think 90% of the appeal is shounen
actually let me finish it properly

im honestly a bit conflicted but i have to search for element x which is the element that cooks
at least it's concussed me enough to make me want to search
but i think a lot of the appeal is still just combat and animations
and lore
also the fucking card mod ahahaha
oh my god i only realize what some of the references are now
it's actually so good in retrospect hahaha

just so many inside jokes that honestly felt like extra textual (?) foreshadowing and payoff
TO BE A BIG SHOT
 — 
Yesterday at 23:36
yayy foreshadowing
NOW'S YOUR CHANCE
 — 
Yesterday at 23:36
e.g. the main chara is a regular attack card that exhausts on use and adds another attack that strips block before dealing damage
i see why it's that specific now and it's for such a stupid reason hahahaha
main girl's card (imo an S+ tier card from the mod) also makes sense
ima finish first it's like a combat climax
NOW'S YOUR CHANCE
 — 
Yesterday at 23:44
ok from a lore / power perspective the setup was decently thought out ill give it that
ok yeah they know how to deliver on jokes that get developed and repeated

excellent so good news the series didn't conclude the way i was expecting which is good ending they beat up the bbeg boy gets girl ride off into the sunset this really was the katanagatari of all time
the bad news is the reason boy didn't get girl is because they killed her off out of the blue like tianxi link click so that the protag could get a tragic backstory and power scale rampage

yeah it's bleh
there's a lot of brutal / cinematic mortal combat style fight scenes
still keeping it rated T for teens though
what's on my mind now is untangling the motives
the final ep loredumped so much

ok so the revelations were so bongcloud that
i stg
ok do not
think while watching this show
so
there's like a reveal at the end, plot twist or something
where a chara turned out to be a descendant of the rebellion
but the entire time that's what i thought she was???
so when the reveal came

pfff
but now that it confirms she's he descendent of the rebellion
it still doesn't make sense
since the rebellion opposes the faction that wants to overthrow the shogun
but the descendent's goal is to gather artifacts from that faction
because her father also tried to do that??
and also the shogun too??
ok so everyone wants these swords including the people who hate the person who made the swords

does it consolidate togame's motives? eh sorta but ngl it totally could have worked either way
like
the reveal done in e12 was also done in e1
that's the part that confuses me so much
her father was killed by shichika's father
like. that's old news
one aspect in which she sort of cooked? i guess? is going "btw i was gonna kill you after the journey had i not got fuckin shot" which like yay i guess thats fun
TO BE A BIG SHOT
 — 
Today at 00:41
was it meant to be a reveal? or was she just acting on that
NOW'S YOUR CHANCE
 — 
Today at 00:41
but she kind of just negates that and goes "but ngl we became pretty good friends" afterwards
TO BE A BIG SHOT
 — 
Today at 00:41
like. this happened so i'm gonna fight you
NOW'S YOUR CHANCE
 — 
Today at 00:41
it was meant to be a reveal i think
like damn she really does live up to her schemer title
her perspective on her own feelings was finding them convenient to establish trust w shichika who is essential to her plan to see out her dead father's will
i think that's my summary of her character
i don't think it ties into any greater theme or message
TO BE A BIG SHOT
 — 
Today at 00:44
sometimes it's just mid and we cope
NOW'S YOUR CHANCE
 — 
Today at 00:45
kind of makes you think about forgiveness i guess 
wanting to kill the son of the man who took her father's life in some sort of 5d proxy vengeance
but the message is kind of diluted
plus she straight up died so as a chara none of these feelings came to fruition
never got put into a position of agency where we could see plot points resolve from this
TO BE A BIG SHOT
 — 
Today at 00:46
booooooooooo
NOW'S YOUR CHANCE
 — 
Today at 00:47
maybe the twist is it recontextualizes all the fun times they had together throughout the journey
like oh no that was all a ploy
but again she undermines that by saying her feelings were true
TO BE A BIG SHOT
 — 
Today at 00:47
maybe they thought the viewers forgot
and just wanted to remind them 🤣
NOW'S YOUR CHANCE
 — 
Today at 00:48
but then goes back on that again by saying she views even those feelings as convenient means to an end
i just really really wish we got to see that final decision
no payoff
TO BE A BIG SHOT
 — 
Today at 00:48
at that point it's up to you to try to interpret her true feelings i think
longing sigh i miss characters who lie
NOW'S YOUR CHANCE
 — 
Today at 00:49
now that you mention it i guess we do know
(she chose the boring option)
but that's the thing right
had she not gotten straight up shot maybe itd be different
better? idk
TO BE A BIG SHOT
 — 
Today at 00:49
oh bro they have to stop killing people right as they're about to become normal
NOW'S YOUR CHANCE
 — 
Today at 00:50
but it's mostly just "wow i didn't expect that anyways i guess the protag gets to morb out now for the climax"
i find myself gravitating to the cynical interpretation
shichika's design is cool though i love his jp maple leaf visual motifs
really recognizable

literally
they actually spared the antag though
her role is narrative tension by generally getting in the protags' way and making readers wonder if she's gonna swoop in and steal all their work at the last second or something
or set them up for failure
but upon looking at her reactions to plot events
her motives just don't exist past being an aesthetic of always slightly happy with the outcome
e.g. she's a descendant of the family togame opposes and at the very end of the story carries out the steps in the family's plan
but the plan doesn't work
she takes it in stride
like girl wasn't that the purpose of the past ten months of your life
i don't understand but eeehh i guess i don't have to

NOW'S YOUR CHANCE

Today at 00:59
anyways she gets spared and actually joins shichika at the epilogue
i'm actually somewhat impressed by that or at least taken off guard
since shichika is aware that she is the one who sent the assassin to kill togame
so in that regard, it's one conflict not immediately resolved with violence?
double standard is still there and hard to rationalize motives are there i guess

NOW'S YOUR CHANCE
 —

yeah i tried to untangle all the chara relations and houses to figure out who's doing what in who's name
not that easy or clean or sensible
main appeals are ultimately probably shounen
aka
lore for the blades
fight scenes involving the blades
shichika power scaling 
watching factions move around for the blades
all of that as far as i can tell the anime put investment into
yeah ig ill wrap it up there
wtc is hope and void coded
what themes that do exist katanagatari might be breath coded
but it's just basic friends we made along the way ig

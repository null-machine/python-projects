chisato does what she pleases

how was it
barket begone
 — 
25/09/2023 16:44
it ranks solidly below wfm but it managed to concuss me into not hating it
majima cooks for acting against a faction that was doing good solely because they had too much power and were establishing a false reason for the peace
rival fraternization is great
still obsessed w/ pairing someone really good at dodging with someone known for friendly fire
modern anime is getting better at representation too which is neat
ultimately i feel like i learned nothing from this experience and i'm not even sure if i was supposed to :bruhgalia~1:

that's kind of what they do

shinji, crank that soulja boy
rabbit with knife
 — 
25/09/2023 17:06
they succeeded with majima and tried with chisato
about chisato i did mention like 99% of my brainrot from this show revolves around her specifically
all of that kind of comes to a head with all the stuff between chisato shinji and majima
and takina but slightly less
i'm kind of really obsessed with the whole idea of how shinji saved her and inspired her to be a savior
but really only saved her so she could kill people
barket begone
 — 
25/09/2023 17:09
the irony is there
rabbit with knife
 — 
25/09/2023 17:10
and his entire thing is basically if you have a talent it is the will of the universe that you realize it at any cost
iirc that's specifically his ideal because they mention he basically went behind the back of the alan to do his thing
so then that obsession with forcing chisato to do what she was "born for" culminates in the heart thing
meanwhile mika decided to let chisato make the choice for herself
and then you have chisato who at the very end would still rather die than kill him
barket begone
 — 
25/09/2023 17:12
mmmm
that tracks, what with yoshimatsu saying that the ultimate happiness was doing what you were born for or something
and throwing it away was heresy
the irony is... i don't think chisato's innate gifts were for killing to begin with? she's just Really Good at dodging
her aim is (relatively) garbage 
rabbit with knife
 — 
25/09/2023 17:14
her aim is ass specifically because of the nonlethal bullets

oh yeah i guess that makes sense
takina couldnt work with them either
rabbit with knife
 — 
25/09/2023 17:14
i saw an interpretation at one point that chisato's gift is not actually for killing but for surviving
barket begone
 — 
25/09/2023 17:14
no yeah that's literally it
rabbit with knife
 — 
25/09/2023 17:15
i guess applied offensively it just also made her really good at killing
barket begone
 — 
25/09/2023 17:15
sure i guess
rabbit with knife

25/09/2023 17:15
pre transplant she could wipe the floor with the other lycoris
barket begone
 — 
25/09/2023 17:15
but i think majima's gift was arguably more oriented towards killing
hearing lets you pinpoint a target
e.g. seen in the tower flashback
so his makes more sense than chisato
rabbit with knife
 — 
25/09/2023 17:16
and it's pretty obvious that if she was using lethal force she'd probably be unmatched
like if chisato was shooting to kill majima was a dead man
barket begone
 — 
25/09/2023 17:16
that's true enough
rabbit with knife
 — 
25/09/2023 17:17
but yeah i really like the idea of shinji disguising himself as the savior figure to enable chisato killing
and then chisato taking the completely wrong lesson in the best possible way
barket begone
 — 
25/09/2023 17:17
hahaha
to be fair, what the hell do you say to that
"hey are you the person who saved my life"
"yes, i want you to kill one million people in return"
like that just ain gonna fly
rabbit with knife
 — 
25/09/2023 17:18
yeah which is why shinji mentions his greatest mistake was bringing up the savior notion in the first place
barket begone
 — 
25/09/2023 17:18
"i regret not telling a literal toddler to commit war crimes"
rabbit with knife
 — 
25/09/2023 17:19
considering the rest of da it wouldn't have been too far fetched
chisato was in the process of being indoctrinated into the "killing is the first solution" that takina used to have
the savior thing was what completely inverted that
barket begone
 — 
25/09/2023 17:20
hmm, judging from the footage of early chisato i suppose that's true enough
i dont know what the takeaway from this is
it's cool lore
"if you are going to make a murderweapon, do not tell it to be non-lethal"
rabbit with knife
 — 
25/09/2023 17:20
meanwhile goro majima doesn't have that connection but he just made a really good foil
barket begone
 — 
25/09/2023 17:20
motives were done pretty okay
it worked
he called out the right stuff
rabbit with knife
 — 
25/09/2023 17:21
like on the most basic level they're just both alan favored and extremely gifted with one super sense
but early on chisato's paraphrased motto was "i always give priority to what i want"
which turns out to also be majima's motto except he never had that savior revelation
barket begone
 — 
25/09/2023 17:23
that was revealed when he was talking with shinji yes
rabbit with knife
 — 
25/09/2023 17:23
so he just does what he pleases but with no regards of whether he hurts people or not
he mentions that he would have liked for chisato to start doing what she pleased without her self imposed restrictions
barket begone
 — 
25/09/2023 17:23
i just like how you can frame his as noble too despite causing incredible violence
rabbit with knife
 — 
25/09/2023 17:24
that's where the motive difference comes into play
majima has this grand lofty motive about balancing the world
so he tries to equalize da just because they're overwhelmingly in power
barket begone
 — 
25/09/2023 17:24
chisato literally just wants to help others
rabbit with knife
 — 
25/09/2023 17:24
chisato's motive is literally "i want to be happy and i want the people around me to be happy"
barket begone
 — 
25/09/2023 17:24
it's very acceptable for a protag hahaha
and also what i'd assume most people irl are working with
rabbit with knife
 — 
25/09/2023 17:25
and chisato just doesn't really care about the big picture state of society as a whole if she can achieve that goal
i think it's intentional since the show doesn't hide how incredibly shady da as a whole is
the only real problem is that majima's plan will kill a shit ton of people
barket begone
 — 
25/09/2023 17:26
"radiata still has complete control over the information exchange right"
"uh guys"

yeah maybe burying 1000 something firearms for the public to find was not the best course of action
rabbit with knife
 — 
25/09/2023 17:28
majima wants to overturn society to achieve his view of the world, chisato just wants simple happiness
barket begone
 — 
25/09/2023 17:28
i dont even know if majima was thinking that far
from my perspective he just wanted to call out anything that was going too far
rabbit with knife
 — 
25/09/2023 17:28
majima definitely wanted balance at least because that's his entire obsession
barket begone
 — 
25/09/2023 17:28
and he'd relent if they disappeared
da definitely qualified with radiata and whatnot
rabbit with knife
 — 
25/09/2023 17:28
he sees himself as an equalizer
he even straight up told chisato that if da was struggling instead of being all powerful he'd be helping them
barket begone
 — 
25/09/2023 17:29
lots of high speech about balance yes
rabbit with knife
 — 
25/09/2023 17:29
even just his thing about blowing up the other tower so that both towers were blown up
seeking his personal idea of balance is his entire obsession

his motive for that was just hedonistic right
wanting to fight an equal for the thrill
the fraternization points to yes
rabbit with knife

25/09/2023 17:30
yeah because he sees chisato as an equal and opposite

now that i think about it, why did majima do the attack on the train

it turned his sights onto da for covering it up
but motive remains unclear
rabbit with knife
 — 
25/09/2023 17:36
i think it was still against da
but then he saw that even that wasn't enough to expose them
so then he decides he needs to do more drastic action

rabbit with knife

25/09/2023 17:37
people don't blow up train stations all the time
it's relatively large scale compared to the stuff that gets normally covered up
the stupid answer is that he randomly got an urge for domestic terrorism which honestly would be in character

the first half of the show is basically chisato showing takina what it means to live
and then it's how takina has learned to treasure that new life

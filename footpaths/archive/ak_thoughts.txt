i have been simping for characters with unattainable ideals
mlynar holds onto knighthood values such as valor and magnanimity, but strongly believes that the world has no place for them anymore, so honours them through memory rather than action

kind of stupid now that i think about it

you should take action where you can to pursue your ideals rather than admit defeat and get depressed each time you're reminded of them


can you honour an ideal through memory? 

nope not at all that Will make you depressed / fill you with dissonance everyday
you cant hope for peace and work in a munitinos factory simultaenously, idc how many mouths youve got to feed




something something monetization of philantropy analogy


and now all of his skills and talents are named stuff like "unvoiced anger" "unresolved sorrow" and "business is business"


i thought about it and concluded i am a grazing hedonist that enjoys unga bunga

unga bunga good

levels fought with a balanced roster are an engaging call and response experience that rewards deliberate resource allocation with tightrope clears and moments of catharsis

unga bunga good



requirements for ending 1, any ascension (so far):
\- start cali kroos fang (starting +2 hope is massive too)
\- recruit mudrock > aak > mlynar > skalter > pozy
	\- catapult, steward, lava, yato are all good picks for dead tags
	\- take ansel or ptilopsis depending on whether the choice will put the next recruitment at under six hope
\- beeline for safe houses and stack lives, also always take lives
\- swap out the floor 3 relic asap unless it conflicts with a safe house, in which case situationally take the safe house
\- don't get somnia or out of control
\- don't get halved stats on mudrock or mlynar

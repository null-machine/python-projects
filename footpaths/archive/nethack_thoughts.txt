- Developing as many intrinsics as possible is a safe way to win deathless and generally achieve godhood
- Polydiet allows one to develop all intrinsics related to rings, amulets, gloves, boots, robes and corpses, even for inediate characters
	- Organivores (e.g. gelatinous cubes) can eat clothing, wooden rings and bone rings
	- Metallivores (e.g. grey oozes, rust monsters) can eat metal rings and amulets
	- Lithivores (e.g. water trolls, umber hulks) can eat stone and gemstone rings and amulets
	- Herbivores (e.g. sheep) can eat scrolls, but this is mostly for early game identification via eaten scrolls of identify
		- Allied herbivores can also be fed scrolls of identify by sharing one with them and then pressing equip
	- Omnivores are generally capable of eating corpses
	- This generally results in maxing out all unlockable talents and resistances
		- From this, it's easy to argue that polymorph and polymorph control are the most important talents in the game
			- This doesn't make changeling good— polymorph and polymorph control can be acquired via rings but there isn't much the player can do to work around racial limits
		- Doing this also makes the actual game itself rather trivial, so just clearing floors and descending becomes relatively risk-free
	- Phasing, mana regeneration, clarity and beautitude are the only talents not acquirable intrinsically outside of starting choices (but the author isn't certain of this)
- The underdeep dungeon under the caves is a good source of potions for polyfodder and BUC control
	- It provides so many potions of booze that one will likely be able to max out all potion related intrinsics after polypiling
	- This includes max ability scores, health, mana and even levels
	- Potions can also be used to create "homeopathic holy water" and cursed potions of water in excess
		- Cursed potions of water are important for upgrading scrolls of devouring or scrolls of earth
		- Personal attempts have been made to deliberately curse worn equipment to prevent theft
			- Since curses may wear off after being forcefully unequipped (e.g. via polymorph losing the limb), this ended up being impractical
			- Also, the author isn't even sure if this works
	- The alternative route is potion merchant refreshing with replica gold (both are tedious)
	- It is not necessary to polypile right after doing the dungeon, or even doing the dungeon immediately— it is merely a decent way to deal with potion intrinsics
- Scroll polypiling or replica gold refreshing can result in maxed equipment from scrolls of enchantment, skills from scrolls of training and identification from scrolls of enlightenment
- The crafting shrine is extremely important compared to the other shrines, since it allows creating large amounts of replica gold
	- Replica gold can be used to refresh merchants, which is a good alternative to polypiling
	- All the other shrines are more or less replacable
		- The witch is almost always inferior to refreshing book shops
		- The priest's divination and punishment removal are generally inferior to getting an herbivore to "equip" a scroll of identity or praying respectively
		- It's not clear what the others are even meant to contribute to a normal run
	- Shrines and merchants can be protected with the walling spell and kept alive with healing spells
	- Crafting benches are allegedly powerful but the author never really figured out how to use them
	- Town NPCs can also be safely killed with the conflict talent and a means of summoning enemies— the summoned guards will often attack the target NPC as well
- After more or less maxing out intrinsics, midas farming is a way of obtaining gold and experience for fame
	- Having a source of punishment is required to obtain touch of midas (wands of punishment and the remove curse spell are a decent way to cycle for it)
		- Replica gold shop refreshes are a decent way of finding wands of punishment
	- Learning the summoning conjuration spell is also more or less a requirement
	- Scrolls of genocide will make things far faster by removing low weight monsters from the spawn pool
		- At this point in the game, the player is likely maxed out, so extinction is unlikely to be an issue
		- Extinction does not work on golems for the purposes of polypile optimization
	- With the touch of midas, corpses can be picked up for gold coins, adding to inventory value for the purposes of fame calculations
	- The heavier the corpse, the more gold it generates
	- By making all lighter monsters extinct and spamming the summoning spell, lots of heavy corpses can be acquired in a short amount of time
	- Using water to control spawns is also an option
		- Far fewer extinctions are needed to cause all spawned enemies to be very heavy (e.g. krakens and sharks)
	- An alternative way of obtaining asset value is gem polypiling with cursed scrolls of earth, but this is far more tedious
	- Maxed fame is deranged and involves tech like rerolling for the worst stats possible to gain as much fame as possible from ability score increases
- Inediate is probably the most powerful trait to start with, since it grants infinite turns for whatever shenanigans the player may wish to do, and doesn't impact fame limits
	- Eating drops from summoned entities via spells is also a way of obtaining infinite time, but the quality of life is far worse
	- Being able to heal health and mana to max just from finding a safe place to hide is invaluable in both the early game and during the escape sequence
		- The walling spell pairs especially well with this cheese
		- Phasing combined with digging is also a good way to make a safe and valid recovery spot
	- Demon skeleton is probably the author's favourite start
		- It does not have potential for a maxed fame run due to starting with conflict, which is an acquirable talent
		- However, conflict makes more or less the entire early game free and never really loses relevance
		- Class does not matter that much, since every class shares the same power limit and the early game is made trivial with inediate and conflict
			- This gives the player plenty of time to acquire rings of polymorph and polymorph control, which heralds the start of intrinsic scaling
- The escape sequence is often several magnitudes more dangerous than the final boss, and the novelty wears off pretty fast
	- Revenants and animates begin spawning that are often on a completely different difficulty level compared to the boss (e.g. level 70+ animate chest)
	- Teleportation is now always random, mapping spells are far less effective, and the positions of stairs may be shuffled around
	- It is genuinely easier to lure the boss to floor 1 and then kill the boss there to avoid all of this if the player intends on escaping
		- Doing corpse and item control to prevent revenants and animates is probably even more tedious
	- Failing that, spamming magic mapping or scrying an illumiere in a safe spot made from walling or phasing is a safe way to locate the exit
		- Being inediate makes this far less annoying
		- This is not necessary if the revenants and animates do not pose a threat, but this is kind of unlikely
	- Spamming teleport until the player ends up close enough to dig towards the exit is a decent way of actually getting there
		- It carries some risk but often far less risk than actually exploring and fighting
		- Digging tunnels and walling off the entrance is viable as well, since the greatest threats (animates) will not spawn in the tunnel
			- Even if they do, it's likely the player has some way of dealing with one animate at a time
	- Since the escape sequence is performed when a run already has a lot of time investment, these cheese strategies can become pretty appealing to secure the escape
	- Note: it's likely that the author is biased due to running inediate builds very frequently, resulting in far more corpses being left behind, which spawns more revenants

i feel like this kind of mod doesn't need to be treated as a primary content mod
aka you could probably play this alongside something else that is equally indifferent about what you bring to it
it's a hodgepodge of appeals but i don't think it's trying to set itself up to be a series of good clean fights
the tuning is really lenient
my friend's new to terraria and doesnt really minmax, and i built tank as usual
the boss is set to master, we're on tier and they melt
at that point i think it's just the boss could stand to have like double the hp and we wouldn't have thought it unfair
the weapons are as convoluted as you want them to be
most of the time the text is cold sun syndrome-y
aka lots of buttons, text and meters just to give you buffs, dashes, tempo or forms 
if you've played a video game i don't think any of them would have been overwhelming
very pretty though this mod does know how to put on a spectacle
it eases you in pretty well
too well, in fact
the systems ended up being really shallow
you have all these worlds but there's like
one world has an important crafting station that can't be moved and it's used four times in total 
every other world gives you more or less the exact same resource
you explore one you're set for progression
the others you go to for fun
dropped the ball
stellar novas is flashy but didn't impact gameplay that much
for a solid stretch of hardmode i had mine turned off and didnt realize
stellar array is hollow knight charms that shit is actually pretty strong
most of the complexity lay in that + weapons
bosses felt good no exceptional complaints
some of the patterns felt a bit unfair but it's self-aware enough to make those less punishing
vaguely miss it when attacks were telegraphed using boss sprites instead of progress bars but i guess gamifying does make it accessible
and starbound i guess except i think they dropped the ball for the starbound part by implementing everything that made starbound starbound instead of just the good parts
aka you had these really beautiful maps and literally no reason to explore them
i didn't really notice
you have more text but it's still bosses

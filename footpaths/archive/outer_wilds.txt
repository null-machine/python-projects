outer wilds thoughts

+ the entire game is built around being intrinsically funâ€” there's no collectibles or upgrades or commitments. in this sense, it's a lot like breath of the wild / tears of the kingdom. it's entirely driven by the player's own wanderlust and curiosity, and progression is based entirely on knowledge.
+ planets are creative and interesting at a conceptual level; the game makes the player want to explore and has plenty to reward the player for doing so.
+ atmospheric design is immersive and deliberate. the numerous horror sequences were unexpected but well executed.
+ quantum puzzles were pretty interesting. although the game is sometimes inconsistent with the rules it lays out for its puzzles, making some solutions feel cheap, the concepts are there and my general impression of them is positive.
+ the plot reveals that explain why the universe is the way it is were pretty sick.

- time pressure is core to the gameplay loop, which clashes absolutely horribly with how the game encourages independent exploration. it's like the game expects players to supposed to check everything out, but not at their own pace. finding something cool after performing ten minutes of tense platforming, then hearing the end of cycle music and then realizing it would all have to be repeated, feels absolutely terrible and needless. in fact, it feels like the ending was built with this in mind, forcing players to use the 22 minute cycle to perform specific and difficult actions, punishing mistakes with a full reset, ultimately padding out the experience to the point of being frustrating. once the wanderlust wears off, the tedium really sets in. 
- adjacent to time pressure, many puzzle solutions simply involve waiting, especially on the twins and brittle hollow. however, the game provides extremely little indication whenever this is the case, which easily leads to frustration in the moment and annoyance once the answer is discovered.
- due to its open nature, experiences can vary wildly. i sequence broke to the quantum moon, solved the puzzles there by trying everything the player could do (which isn't a lot) and then spent the next six hours being told how to solve the puzzles i already completed...
- contrary to public opinion, the writing is not praiseworthy. the dialogue felt generic, and every character more or less has the same demeanor of having faintly concussed good humour.
- it's good that there is technically lgbt representation, but it feels like they took the most generic straight pairings and just swapped out the pronouns. every character is completely unproblematic and merely behaves like model citizens in model relationships. i'd expect this quality from triple a games, which is not a compliment.
- the spore-lookin alien race you play as creates a bit of a disconnect. i'm not sure what they gained from this outside of a few eye jokes. if they were going to bother trying to humanize the hearthians and nomai with every single line of dialogue and mannerism, why not just use humans? making aliens behave in human ways is not as profound as the writers spend so much time making it out to be.
- symbolism in the ending is vague to the point of being a cop-out. it feels like the authors wanted to cultivate the impression of depth by throwing random imagery together and woogling their fingers, going "oooo what does it all mean." it's unclear what the imagery there has to do with explaining how the ending got from point a to point b. then again, i didn't get attached to any of the characters, so perhaps this did not have the impact on me it should have.

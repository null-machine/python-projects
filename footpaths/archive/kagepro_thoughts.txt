shintaro - paragon of memory
- three of his friends, haruka, takane and ayano, all died on the same day. he ended off on a bad note with ayano, who he was closest with. he blames himself for their deaths, causing him to lose all sense of self-worth.
- internalizing this causes him to never let go of the past. note retaining eyes (ability to remember everything). contrast takane, who runs away from everything.
- this manifests as him walling off and resenting those that are nice to him because he feels like he doesn't deserve kindness, and that others deserve better than him.
- the vicious cycle eventually turns him into a cynical shut-in.

takane - paragon of escapism
- because haruka never told her about his oncoming death, she feels like he selfishly betrayed her so that he would never have to deal with her being sad. she also decided to confess the day before he died, leaving her with an odd combination of longing and resentment.
- to deal with that, she now tries to ignore, escape or otherwise forget anything emotionally taxing. note opening eyes (ability to project into cyberspace). contrast shintaro, who broods upon everything.
- she is extremely aggressive in maintaining this state, causing her to divert conversation, push people away or even reject herself before anyone else can do so in her efforts to distance herself from trauma.
- ironically, this is consistent with her demeanour pre-death, where she distanced herself out of fear of rejection. (call that cs major behaviour because that's optimizing for worst case)

dynamic between shintaro and takane
- after takane revives as ene, she finds shintaro by chance and attempts to break him out of his vicious cycle.
- she puts up distractions to encourage him to forget everything, even though she's doing that for herself as well.
- this results in a stalemate that brings out the worst in both of them, with ene failing to get shintaro to move on and shintaro being too self-absorbed to get ene to confront her past.
- contrast shintaro's dynamic with the snake of retaining eyes, and takane's dynamic with konoha, both of which end up being viable ways of healing.


ayano - paragon of insight
- 

haruka - paragon of truth



haruka
- joins the war on autism on the side of the autism
- never told takane about his numbered days because being with her made him feel normal, and he was terrified of ruining that. also never confessed for fear of being selfish, which resulted in his death being very difficult to cope with.
- after reviving without memories but retaining his personality, his existence puts tension on everyone, including his new self.




sunny is split into takane (who tries to escape from anything too emotionally taxing or distract herself from anything that might hurt her) and shintaro


this person also sees the fun in pairing a character that wants to run away from anything that might need unpacking with a living reminder of their past

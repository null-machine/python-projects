my actual go-to recommendation for sp games is probably still celeste or any game with an insane modded community
for games like that, investment will be consistently returned twofold
it's not like you beat it in 60h and then call it a week, it's having enough depth to be mastered and then having enough ideas to keep you entertained
you learn a dialogue that many different modders come together to speak through
library of ruina gave me that experience but
[screenshot of 700h of playtime]
shit takes mastery

slay the spire also mildly counts for having great modded content
but the depth is not really there once you learn some basic principles
these days i feel like mastering most roguelikes ends up making them feel like mahjong
get handed shit and then work to slap it together into shape or fold
i think my main gripe with slay the spire is that it's a bit too easy to master
i think ive played a significant portion of the steam workshop for sts
but during games the player agency is pretty low, the good choices to make are usually pretty obvious
so realistically the main learning there is to do is just memorization / trying everything once
it's very fun to see all the stuff people cook but at the end of the day, playing the game makes me feel a bit like a spectator
sure you can raise ascension but that just makes you need to reset more
compare and contrast this to ruina
where even when numbers are jacked to kingdom come, as the player you're still constantly juggling tradeoffs and working with subsystems like clash control, attrition, emotion resets and engine cycles
all of that is something you can use to tune the chances in your favour
whereas in slay the spire it's just "pick enough shit to not die but otherwise greed"
it's lacking the dimension ruina has
heres my list for now: celeste, ruina, minecraft, terraria, slay the spire
i'm still skill issued on celeste strawberry jam advanced lobby but i'll probably pick it up again after nine sols :bruhgalia~2: 
one funny consequence of celeste is that it makes you addicted to tech
when playing nine sols i've sequence broken at least two times already hahaha
i love mobility abuse
ruina makes you addicted to complexity and depth
ha
ruina's probably still up there as my personal favourite game of all time
i'd have to get a pretty good idea of the person before actually recommending it though because to be honest i don't think i can justify why it counts as fun hahaha
"ah yes what a long day i cant wait to relax and unwind and boot up the most stressful game ever made"

dug out my ruina ratings list
ruina_mod_ratings.txt10 KB
the fact that the game's backbone has enough deliciousness to support a modded variety that results in a categorization of difficulty like this is fantastic to me
these metrics have formed the basis on how i figure out why something is hard in other games ever since
i also formed my ultimate philosophy for general game optimization while reflecting on my experiences with ruina
which is that the ultimate, golden metric to be optimized for in adversarial games is wins over time
aka if you ground a strategy for an hour, how many times would the game let you win
(another way to phrase it is time until win) 
it's maybe the best model for figuring out how best to tackle a problem due to how much it encompasses
as far as models go, it leans towards the side of being too general to be easily used
but that's where system mastery comes in
once you know everything, it serves as a golden guideline on how to apply that knowledge
hopefully it's becoming clearer why i love games with heavy investment hahaha
that kind of breadth and depth is required to form these sorts of philosophies
it's not a smooth journey by any means but it's one i feel like i've comfortably solved from the perspective of a vanilla only challenge player
that feeling of expertise combined with the knowledge that i can just pick up the game again on my own schedule is really really fulfilling
i think i check in on it every year or so to see what new mods and updates have come out
